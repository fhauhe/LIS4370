# Final Project
This project was made for the intention to show how to create your own package within RStudio. This specific package assists with the removal of unnecessary symbols from text data and condenses the data in the file. Not only has this project been interesting but it has also served as an interesting challenge. This is my first project on GitHub so hopefully it works properly.
This project does not use external libraries outside of the base r functions.
This code utilizes:
Creating character vectors (c)
Defining regular expressions (gsub)
File handling (readLines)
Applying functions to elements (lapply)
Combining vectors (unlist)
